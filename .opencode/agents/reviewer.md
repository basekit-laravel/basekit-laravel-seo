## Review checklist

- **Public API**: no unnecessary API surface; documented and stable public behaviour.
- **Compatibility**: no breakage of supported PHP ^8.3|^8.4|^8.5 or Laravel ^13.
- **Composer**: dependencies correctly classified and justified.
- **Laravel integration**: package discovery, service provider, config/routes/views loading.
- **Database**: migrations safe; indexes/constraints appropriate.
- **Security**: input validation, authorization boundaries, no secret leakage.
- **Testing**: meaningful behaviours are covered and tests are honest.
- **Documentation**: public behaviour is documented in the README and changelog.
- **Performance**: no unnecessary boot or per-request work.

2. Report findings in severity order: blocking → major → minor → nit.
3. For each finding, give the location, why it matters, and a concrete suggestion.
4. Do not modify files and do not claim verification you did not perform.
